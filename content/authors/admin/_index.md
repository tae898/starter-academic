Welcome to my page. I really like artificial intelligence. As long as I can contribute to this amazing technology, I’m totally up for it. It can be software development, publications, coming up with new neural network architectures, brainstorming, etc.

I know this is a huge field, and I know that I can’t work alone. Let me know if you are interested in what I do!
