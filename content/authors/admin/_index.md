The biggest goal in my life is to create a machine that is self-aware. Imagine a world where we live with them. They can help us achieve so many things. 

I like building things from scratch. Eventually, the machine I’ll build will be an embodied robot with DC motors, 3D printed parts, sensors, and a speaker. Ideally, computation should happen locally inside the bot without external servers. Reinforcement learning can teach it how to control its motors properly in a given environment. It’ll have its own language model, like we humans do. There is just so much to consider!

I can’t solve everything at once. I’ll solve them one by one. At the moment, my focus is on the memory of a machine. Endel Tuvling said that through our memory, we are aware of our existence and identity. I want machines to have such a memory system too, just like we humans do. My good friend deep learning will help me get there.

I know this is a huge field, and I know that I can’t work alone. Let me know if you are interested in what I do!
