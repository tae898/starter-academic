The biggest goal in my life is to contribute to artificial general intelligence. It's a pretty big and ambitious goal. But with our collective knowledge in machine learning and cognitive science, I know that we will get there. I can't do this alone. I want to do it together with you. Please don't hesitate to contact me.
